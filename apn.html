           <P>Start your pilgrimage through Andhra Pradesh with the Sri Venkateswara temple. From Tirupati, where you can catch a flight, you can take a taxi to the temple.
             The temple's patron saint is Lord Venkateswara, a form of Vishnu.  </P>

             <P>The religious significance stems from the fact that it is devoted to Lord Shiva and holds one of his twelve Jyotirlingas. You will be enthralled by the four gopurams,
                 or entry pillars, in addition to the temple's holiness.  </P>

                While there, offer prayers in front of the revered shrine dedicated to Goddess Durga and take some time to yourself. According to legend, Arjuna received
